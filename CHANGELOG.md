# v0.0.2
### September 19, 2020
* Use the `license` field instead of the `license-file` field in the Cargo.toml of `pb-jelly` and `pb-jelly-gen`. 
    * Note: The License is still the same, the update is purely for better metadata from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/pb-jelly)
* Warn on `rust_2018_idioms` closes [#45](https://github.com/dropbox/pb-jelly/issues/45)
* A few changes related solely to re-integrating `pb-jelly` into the Dropbox codebase.
